# Welcome to the site!

Hello! My name is Saul and I am an undergrad senior at MIT studying Computer Science & Engineering. I will be using this site to share and go over any thing I find interesting throughout my research and academic journey. Throughout my time in MIT, I strived to help with research centered on disease and health either through my own research endeavors, or by developing software tools that could help physicians and researchers. I plan to pursue an MEng in Computer Science at MIT the following academic year.
