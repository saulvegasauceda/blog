# Welcome to the site!

Hello! My name is Saul and I am a junior at MIT studying Computer Science & Engineering. I will be using this site to share and go over any thing I find interesting throughout my research and academic journey. Throughout my time in MIT, I strived to learn about disease and health through data and see what rules of math and data science can help us leverage new insights.
